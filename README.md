In order to create accounts for two nodes for the network with a separate datadir for each using geth, I followed the step by step PoA Guide. 

I accessed the terminal in my geth folder and ran the following commands: 
> ./geth --datadir node1 account new
> ./geth --datadir node2 account new

Once these nodes were set up, I created a genesis block using puppeth.
